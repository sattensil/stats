#  Lists are something like vectors, but
#  do not have the restriction that all
#  elements must have the same mode.

#  A vector must have all its elements be numeric, or character,
#  or logical, etc.

#  Example

x = c(1,2,3,4)
y = c("ab","fgh")
z = c(TRUE,FALSE)
f <- function(x) { return(sin(2*x)) } # f(x) = sin(2x)

#  str() gives the "structure" of its argument
