### Intro to Probability

### R uses r<dist>, d<dist>, p<dist>, and q<dist> functions for the
### most common probability distributions.
### Here, <dist> stands for the distribution. For example <dist> could be
### norm for the normal distribution, or <dist> could be exp for the exponential
### distribution. 

### rnorm() and rexp() will generate random variables from the normal and exponential
### distributions respectively. The first argument to a r<dist> function is the number 
### of random variable you want to generate. The other arguments will generally be the
### parameters associated with the distribution. You can look up the arguments and their
### meaning by doing a ?rexp command, for example. If the internet is not available to you,
### you can always do an experiment.

### which parameterization does rexp use? lambda or theta?
### let's experiment. If it uses lambda, mean(t) = 1/lambda and var(t) = 1/lambda^2
### If it uses theta, then mean(t) = theta and var(t) = theta^2
t = rexp(200000,10)
sprintf("length(t) = %d  mean(t) = %8.6f  var(t) = %8.6f",length(t),mean(t),var(t))
###  Evidently rexp uses lambda

### Simlarly for rnorm, or rgamma, you can experiment to find out if rnorm uses the
### standard deviation or the variance as a parameter
t = rnorm(20000,3,100)
sprintf("length(t) = %d  mean(t) = %8.6f  var(t) = %8.6f",length(t),mean(t),var(t))
### Evidently the second parameter is mu, and the third parameter is sigma (NOT sigma^2)
### rnorm defaults to the standard normal, so if that is what you want you need only specify
### the number of samples you desire
t = rnorm(200000)
sprintf("length(t) = %d  mean(t) = %8.6f  var(t) = %8.6f",length(t),mean(t),var(t))

####  the d and p prefix before <dist> give the pdf and CDF respectively for the <dist>
####  distribution. See this example
