#    coupon6 function
#
#    Specialized to 6 coupons
#
#    This code is not good for a general number of coupons
#    It gives an idea of one kind of strategy that may work
#    very well in other applications
#
#    Simulates the distribution of number of coupons bought
#    to acquire at least one of each coupon type.

#    Another interpretation is: how many permutations from sample()
#    do we compute before we have computed all 6 permuations?
