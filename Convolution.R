#  source convolution routine

# Convolution has many uses.
# (1) Finding the pdf of a sum of independent RVs
# (2) Multiplying polynomials
# (3) Filtering, or calculating the response
#     of a linear time invariant system
# (4) Convolution in the time domain is the same
#     as multiplication in the frequency domain
# (5) Convolution n the frequency domain is the same
#     as multiplication in the time domain

# Z = X + Y
# X ~ binomial(n1,p1)
# Y ~ binomial(n2,p2)
#
# If p1 = p2, then Z ~ binomial(n1+n2,p1)
# If p1 != p2 then.....

# Look at an example
n.x  = 8      # X
p.x  = 0.7

n.y = 5      # Y
p.y = 0.4

#  P(Z = k) = SUM( i = 0 to i = k ) {P(X = i)*P(Y = k- i)}
#  Example: P(Z=2) = P(X=2)*P(Y=0) + P(X=1)*P(Y=1) + P(X=0)*P(Y=2)
#  Note that X+Y = 2 in each product
#  Note that each event summed is mutually exclusive with the
#  other events.
#  We cannot have both {X=2,Y=0} and {X=1,Y=1}, for example
#  Since X and Y are independent, we can mutiply the pdf
#  of X and Y to obtain the probability of the joint event
#  {X = i, Y = k - i}

#  First we flip the pdf of Y about the vertical axis

# put a lot credence in your results use a big number of samples
# How much more time did it take to use 1000000 samples vs. 10000
# samples? Was the increase in accuracy worth the extra wait?

####   Explanation. Consider the vector (0,1,1,1,1,1,1)*(1/6)
####   To ease computations, we ignore the 1/6 factor for now.

####   Convolution works like this:
#           index 0     index 6
#             |           |
#             |           |

# 1 1 1 1 1 1 0                  <- flipped vector

# The output is the sum of the overlapped products.
# For mathematical ease I will pretend R allows us to
# use a zero index into a vector (as C does).
# In R code, the actual index for y is one bigger than
# shown here.
# R does not allow zero to be an index to a vector. Remember
# here that P(Y = k) is stored in y[k+1].

#  k = 1 output has only one position with overlap.
#     So we sum 0*0, and y[1] = 0

#          1 1 1 1 1 1 0        <- flipped vector moved right 2
#  k = 6 output is  y[6] = 4

#  k = 9 output is y[9] = 5

# Now as k gets bigger the overlap gets smaller.

# in short the output sequence looks like:
#  0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1
#
# Recall we ignored the (1/6) factor to do this.
# When we reintroduce the factor, we multiply by 1/36,
# since both the original and moving flipped vators had
# a 1/6 factor removed. This completely explains the result
# of throwing two die.
